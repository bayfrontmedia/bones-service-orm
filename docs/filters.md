# [ORM service](README.md) > Filters

The following [filters](https://github.com/bayfrontmedia/bones/blob/master/docs/services/filters.md) are added by this service:

- `orm.query.filter`: Applied to filter values received from a [QueryParserInterface](utilities/queryparserinterface.md).
 This filter is used by the `ResourceModel` to support [dynamic variables](utilities/queryparserinterface.md#getfilter).
